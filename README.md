# Random Walks - Omnet

This is a project on my degree's Thesis regarding information dissemination in Wireless Sensor Networks.

In this project, I utilize a C++ Framework, Omnet++ to model and measure the effectiveness of the Random Walker algorithm as well as other variations I found, in addition to my own Hybrid model. 

I also employ my own Relative Radius Connection variable and an energy measurement heuristic widely used in the LEACH algorithm.
