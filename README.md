# Random Walks in WSNs

This is a project on my degree's Thesis regarding information dissemination in Wireless Sensor Networks.

In this project, I utilize a C++ Framework, Omnet++ to model and measure the effectiveness of the Random Walker algorithm as well as other variations I found, in addition to my own Hybrid model. 

I additionally employ my own Relative Radius Connection variable and an energy measurement heuristic widely used in the LEACH algorithm. 

## Results and Topologies

All data I use in my thesis are located in /simulations/prints/data/plotting/

While most quantifications are made in the common randomized RGG topology, I also make use of a GridNet and a custom network topology that follows Taxi Stands in Athens, Greece, as received from the ministry of Transportation.
